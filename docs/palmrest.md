# Palm rest
- [**Back to list**](https://github.com/Evv1L/thinkpad-x230-upgrades/blob/main/README.md)

**Avoid non original palm rest**. At least I had non original and it was a bit bigger, bad plastic and no ducts for fluid drainage.<br/>
Palm rests variants:
- Normal palm rest
- Palm rest with a fingerprint reader
Also you can place 2nd mSATA under palmrest if you have a.gain board and palm rest without fingerprint.
