# ExpressCard 54 slot
- [**Back to list**](https://github.com/Evv1L/thinkpad-x230-upgrades/blob/main/README.md)

There are ExpressCards you can install:
## Smartcard reader
If you really want it.
## 2xUSB 3.0 adapter
**Buy adapter with ASM1042 controller**, otherwise your adapter will have heating problems.
## 3xUSB 3.0 adapter
I don't recomend it because of limited space and overheating, but you still can install it.
## ExpressCard to M.2 2242 NVMe adapter (and USB 3.0)
In short, sequential reads/writes may not be faster than a good SATA SSD but random 4K reads/writes are significantly faster due to the faster protocol. Even dram-less SSD is marginally faster than SATA.
Also M.2 with USB 3.0 port are available.
## WIFI and in ExpressCard
> Need more info from xyte.ch
## External Graphics Card (eGPU)
750Ti and external screen is recomended due to limited bandwith of ExpressCard
