There are 2 adapter boards for X230: from nitrocaster and e.gain (阿甘)
**Nitrocaster**'s adapter board allows you to install modern, 1080p eDP displays.
Adapter board from **e.gain** also allows you to install modern screens, but this board supports 2K displays and adds mSATA slot for SSDs, that you can install under palm rest. This mSATA slot works on SATA III speed.
