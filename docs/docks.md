# Docks
> TODO: Is Ultrabase uses SATA III?
There are 2 docks for X230 that I personally owned:
- ThinkPad **Ultrabase** Series 3
- ThinkPad Mini Dock Plus Series 3 with USB 3.0 (**4338**)

**Ultrabase** have a SATA III slot for HDD/SSD or CD drives, DisplayPort, 4xUSB 2.0, VGA, Microphone jack, Headphone jack.
**Mini Dock (4338)** have USB 3.0, 2xDisplayPort, 6xUSB 2.0, VGA, Microphone jack, Headphone jack.

Linux doesn't detect drive from UltraBase dock after sleep and reattach. Mini Dock 4338 doesn't have this problem, because it uses USB intead of SATA to connect drives.
You can use Ultrabase dock for booting or installing Windows because of SATA interface.
